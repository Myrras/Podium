 * Most animation in Podium is pure CSS (transitions + keyframes driven by the
 * `--dur-*` / `--ease-*` tokens in `tokens.css`). The one thing CSS can't do on
 * its own in React is animate an element *out* before it unmounts — once the
 * component returns `null`, the node is gone and there's nothing left to
 * transition. `usePresence` bridges that: it keeps a closing element mounted for
 * the length of its exit animation, exposing a `data-state` the CSS keys off.
 *
 * Durations here mirror the `--dur-*` CSS tokens (ms). They MUST stay in sync:
 * the JS timer below decides when to actually unmount, and the CSS decides how
 * long the exit visually takes — a mismatch either clips the animation or leaves
 * a dead node on screen.
